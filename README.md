# README

Welcome to xxxxx, written by 

This is our program

By the end of the day, you will have a repository with a name, the names of the authors, and an introduction that introduces the project, justifies its existence, and provides a rough description of the steps required to take an input dataset and transform it to the desired output dataset.

```
The name of the program
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

The authors of the programs
Name of students in your group

The purpose for writing the program 
Let people know what your program can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. Also, depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or images. Remember your favorite animal repository!!

What they need to have installed to run the program
However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Do they need R packages? Python Libraries?

How to actually use the program 
The commands to run, how to access the help menu, etc. Show the expected output if you can. Itâ€™s helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
